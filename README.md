Rose
====

**This library is obsolete – please use the proposed
[regexp](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/42) crate instead.**

**Rose** is a simple regular expression engine written in Rust.  Its
design is based mostly on the Pike VM, as described by [Russ Cox][1].

[1]: http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html

Rose aims to be simple, predictable, and correct above all else.  This
means obscure or unsound features, like [atomic groups][] or
[backreferences][] or [lookaround][], are not supported.  In return, it
does not suffer from the [exponential blowup][] that plagues other
engines.

[atomic groups]: http://www.regular-expressions.info/atomic.html
[backreferences]: http://www.regular-expressions.info/backref.html
[lookaround]: http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html
[exponential blowup]: http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html
